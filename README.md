# Prime Editing: Our Future? #
## Crispr v. Gene Editing ##

***CRISPR***: Well, hello there. My name is CRISPR. Recently, last year in October to be precise, I was apparently upgraded to a better version of myself. I was the future of gene therapy, the only great gene editing species on the planet. But now, I am not. Welcome to my downfall and the rise of prime editing. 

In October of 2019, Dr. David Liu at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, presented a gene editing technique, known as prime editing, that would search and replace rather than simply deactivate. I myself, CRISPR 1.0, scan DNA for errors, and upon finding the error, cut both DNA strands into two pieces. 

***Researcher***: However, as continuous research has shown, sometimes cuts are made in the wrong place, which can cause viruses to mutate and evolve. In CRISPR, insertions and deletions are called indels. They’re unpredictable. So, they can offset the genetic code for a protein. Simply, when things go to plan, CRISPR helps reduce the number of mutations, but if repair goes wrong…

***CRISPR***: Stop right there, I am CRISPR, the king, the only gene editing technique that should exist! I am cheap and easy to make. I am proven to work. How is prime editing so much better? How is it an upgrade?

***Researcher***: Unlike CRISPR, Prime Editing does not cut both DNA strands. This ensures that the cell’s repair system does not detect the damage made to the DNA, allowing scientists to be able to complete the correct edit, without leaving it up to chance.
  
1. A separate CRISPR tool is necessary to delete a gene and make a DNA letter substitution. However, prime editing does not need additional modifications to delete and insert, and so there will be less overhead investment for using it in gene therapy.

2. Prime editing can target about 90% of inherited diseases, as it can edit a single DNA letter or up to 80 at one time. For example, for sickle-disease, prime editing can edit a single Thymine to an Adenine, to eliminate the deforming of the oxygen-carrying blood cells.
 
3. Unlike CRISPR, prime editing can edit DNA in cells that can no longer divide. This allows for gene editing to attack mutations in smaller populations of cells, which was previously not possible.

## Prime Editing: How does it work ##
***CRISPR***: Well, how does Prime Editing Work? Doesn’t it use a CAS-9 enzyme too?
Researcher: It does indeed. Think about prime editing’s processes as computer functions. First, you use Ctrl-F to find a piece of text you want to copy over. Then, you use Ctrl-C to copy over that piece of text; finally, by pressing Ctrl-V, you are able to copy over the old text with the new text. In this same way, prime editing involves the fusing of two enzymes CAS-9 nickase and reverse transcriptase, as well as a guide or pegRNA (a larger type of sgRNA than used in CRISPR, with a primer binding sequence).
